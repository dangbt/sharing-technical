#### A pattern
- a reusable solution that can be applied to commonly occurring problems in software design - in our case - in writing JavaScript web applications. Another way of looking at patterns are as templates for how we solve problems - ones which can be used in quite a few different situations.

### Design patterns have three main benefits:

- Patterns are proven solutions: They provide solid approaches to solving issues in software development using proven techniques that reflect the experience and insights the developers that helped define them bring to the pattern.
- Patterns can be easily reused: A pattern usually reflects an out of the box solution that can be adapted to suit our own needs. This feature makes them quite robust.
- Patterns can be expressive: When we look at a pattern thereâ€™s generally a set structure and vocabulary to the solution presented that can help express rather large solutions quite elegantly.
